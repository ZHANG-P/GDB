# Guide to GDB 

GDB is a powerful debugger for C, along with many other languages. It's part of the GNU package, which contains free software (the gcc compiler, emacs, etc.) that is installed on the virtual machine that we provided you. As a result, GDB is the debugger used by CSCI3150 at CUHK. Learn to love it; GDB pros have a much easier time tracking down bugs that those who muddle through using guesses and infinite amounts of printf statements.

This document is designed to give you a brief introduction to using GDB for CSCI3150. It's purposely short: the idea is that you get the basics here and check out the online [GDB manual](http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/index.html) when you want more.
