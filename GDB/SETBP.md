# Breakpoints

Here we start to debug a mini program _**computeSeriesValue**_. For showing how to set breakpoints in variant ways, we divide code among two source files, _main.c_ and _computeSeriesValue.c_.

_main.c_:

```C
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<math.h>
extern double computeSeriesValue(double x, int n);

int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
	double x;
	int n;
	x = atof(argv[1]);
	n = atoi(argv[2]);
	printf("This program is used to compute the value of the following series:\n");
	printf("(x^0)/0! + (x^1)/1! + (x^2)/2! + (x^3)/3! + (x^4)/4! + ...... + (x^n)/n!\n");
	printf("The value of the series for x=%f, n=%d is %f\n", x, n, computeSeriesValue(x, n));
	return 0;
}
```
_computeSeriesValue.c_:

```C
#include<stdio.h>
int computeFactorial(int number) {
	int fact = 0;
	for(int j = 1; j <= number; j++) {
		fact = fact *j;
	}
	return fact;
}
double computeSeriesValue(double x, int n) {
	double seriesValue = 0.0;
	double xpow = 1;
	for(int k = 0; k <= n; k++){
		seriesValue += xpow / computeFactorial(k);
		xpow = xpow * x;
	}	
	return seriesValue;
}
```
This program is used to compute the value of the following series:

(x^0)/0! + (x^1)/1! + (x^2)/2! + (x^3)/3! + (x^4)/4! + ...... + (x^n)/n!

_Makefile_ has been prepared for you, you just need enter `make` in the terminal prompt to compile the source files. Howere, when you execute  _**computeSeriesValue**_ given **x** and **n**(**n**>=0, and **n** should be an integer here) as input, the program outputs a value of infinity, regardless of the inputs.

Apparently, there are some bugs in this program. So we can use GDB to debug it. Let's fire it up now. 

## Setting Breakpoints
Just starting the debugger to run the program straight through isn't very usefulâ€”we need to stop execution and get into stepping mode.
Normally, your program only stops when it exits. Breakpoints allow you to stop your program's execution wherever you want, be it at a function call or a particular line of code. Breakpoints are an essential tool that allow you to stop and examine the program state at a specific context within the execution. Before you enter `run` in gdb prompt to start your program, you want to set up your breakpoints. The `break` or `b` command will allow you to do so. Here we list three methods to set breakpoints, which are normally used and powerful.

- `break main`			Break at the beginning of main() function 
- `break 5`				Break at line 5 of current file 
- `break main.c:5` 		Break at line 5 of main.c

In order to debug _**computeSeriesValue**_, we set breakpoints before starting the program. 

(1) Set a breakpoint at line 12 of current file _main.c_. You can use command `info break` to view the breakpoints that you have set. 
![break line](./figs/breakline.png)

(2) Break at line 13 of _computeSeriesValue.c_. Use `list`(abbreviated `l`) command to show a spcific line in a source file. 
![break line file](./figs/breakfileline.png)

(3) Break at the begining of function computeFactorial().

To clear a breakpoint, use the `clear` command with the breakpoint location. You can aslo clear a breakpoint by number with `delete` command. Sometimes, we may find that some breakpoints are not necessary. For example, the breakpoint at the begining of function computeFactorial() is redudant. So, here we use `delete 3` command to clear the third breakpoint.

## Stepping Arround

After entering `run 3.0 2`(the correct output should be 8.5), we've arrived at main() and execution has stopped at the breakpoint we set there. If you're running in dumb terminal mode, gdb will print the line it will execute next. Here, we're running in cool GUI mode, with switch `--tui` open, the line it will execute next will be highlighted in the source window.

In order to execute the next line and step into function computeSeriesValue(), enter `step`(abbreviated `s`) command in the gdb prompt. We also use `next`(abbreviated `n`) command, which is similar to `step` except it will step over (instead of into) functions. Finally we reach the next breakpoint. To execute the program consecutively , we can use `continue`(abbreviated `c`) command.

If you want to know where you are in the program's execution(and how, to some extent, you got there), you can view the contents of the stack using the `backtrace`(abbreviated `bt`) commands as follows:
![backtrace](./figs/backtrace.png)

## Inspecting Variables

Along with the `step` and `next` commands, we can use `print`(abbreviated `p`) command to print the values of variables. When arriving at the breakpoint at line 13 of _computeSeriesValue.c_, print value of **seriesValue**, then step over function computeFactorial() with `next` command, print **seriesValue** again. We find that **seriesValue** become **inf**.
![print values](./figs/print.png)
You know we are very interested in the variable **seriesValue**, there is a simple method to inspect this variable with `display` command. GDB will print the values of variables that we are interested automatically every step. To view the information of display, `info display` can help. We can use `undisplay` followed by a variable number, which command `info display` will show, to cancel the inspect of this variable. 
![display](./figs/display.gif)

Now, we can know that the expression `xpow/computeFactorial(k)` is **inf**. Here **xpow** is **1** and **k** is **0**. It is sure that bugs locate in function computeFactorial(). After analyzing the source code of this function, we find that `int fact = 0` will make return value of this function always be 0. Bingo! We find the bug, and replace `int fact = 0` with `int fact = 1` then. 


We compile the source code by `make` and test the program as follows:
